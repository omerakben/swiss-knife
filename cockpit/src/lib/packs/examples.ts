// Two reference packs that double as living documentation and as validator
// fixtures (manifest.test.ts asserts both pass with zero errors). They show the
// two ends of the v1 ladder: Small Business Ops is a pure L0 content pack (the
// first mass-market pack), QA and Product Ops is an L1 pack that surfaces routes
// and leans on deterministic gates that already exist in this repo (the first
// professional pack). Neither requests network, sending, code, or autonomy.

import { defaultPermissions, type PluginManifest } from "./manifest";

// First mass-market pack. Content only (templates, facts, task seeds) so it
// installs by seeding alone, no new routes or code. Proves the app can move
// beyond developers.
