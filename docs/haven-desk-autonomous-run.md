# Haven Desk autonomous run log

Living status doc for the autonomous build of Haven Desk. Ozzy is the owner and the gate; Claude is the lead operator, working with Codex as builder/verifier. Read this to catch up; the changelog at the bottom is appended as work lands.

Last updated: 2026-06-26.

## Operating agreement

Claude runs the buildable work end to end and stops at the gates below for Ozzy. Each unit of work is committed locally per feature, gated (lint, unit, build, and e2e or a live browser check), and recorded here.

What Claude proceeds on without asking: design, build, refactor, tests, local commits, docs, and using Codex as builder/verifier.

What Claude stops and asks Ozzy for (the gates):
- Pushing to the remote or opening a pull request.
- Spending money, or any payment or licensing integration.
- Anything external-facing or published: marketing posts, a website, sending email.
- Credentials or secrets.
- Destructive operations: wiping the dev DB, force-pushing, deleting Ozzy's data.
- The installer's real-human setup test (needs Ozzy and a few non-technical people).

## Where things stand (verified)

Branch `codex/haven-desk-transition`, not pushed. The app is live and works for a technical user with a running stack: rebranded Haven Desk, persona-first nav, a Packs surface that installs validated packs, and pack content that appears in the tools. Trust gaps from the readiness audit are closed (local-only prompt-sync, Open WebUI telemetry off, high-stakes packs gated as ERRORs).

Readiness verdict (see `haven-desk-release-readiness-audit.md`): demo-ready for a technical audience; not closed-alpha ready (the terminal setup blocks non-technical users); not paid-launch ready (no installer, onboarding, or licensing).

## Work queue (Claude drives top-down; gated items wait for Ozzy)

1. First impression for non-technical users: rewrite the first-run card (done), then a persona picker and a dashboard that does not lead with developer tools.
2. One real 10-minute outcome: make the Small Business Ops meeting-notes workflow create actual Task records, not just text. Codex builds, Claude reviews (or the reverse).
3. Deepen the first two packs to the workflow set the monetization plan promises.
4. A one-command or double-click setup wrapper to lower the install wall (the full installer and its human test are an Ozzy gate).
5. Privacy/trust UX surface (a "where is my data" panel) so the local-first promise is visible.

## How to review

- Read the commits on `codex/haven-desk-transition` (conventional messages, one per feature).
- Read `haven-desk-release-readiness-audit.md` for the verdict and the critical path.
- Run the app: `cd cockpit && npm run dev`, open the printed URL (the stack needs native Ollama running).
- To get it on GitHub for remote review, tell Claude "push" and it will open a draft PR.

## Changelog

- 2026-06-26: Shipped the transition (docs + pack validator), live v1 (rebrand, persona nav, Packs surface, install), a 5-lens readiness audit, and trust hardening. 9 commits. Started the first-impression work with the first-run card rewrite.
- 2026-06-26 (cont.): Shipped the value proof. `/tools/meeting-notes` turns pasted notes into real Task records (chatJson extraction, a tested deterministic gate, review-and-edit, then a transactional create; the model runs only on extract). Verified live on gemma4:e4b (pasted notes produced 3 dated, owner-tagged tasks that landed in the Tasks board). Codex-reviewed SHIP-READY; its findings (clearable owner/due chips, owner cap, stale-row clear) fixed.
- 2026-06-26 (cont.): The dashboard now groups tool cards by the persona-first nav sections (Favorites, then Today, Capture, Write, Projects, Packs, Settings) instead of one flat grid, so a non-technical user leads with everyday tools and the professional tools sit in a clearly-labelled section. Next: a first-run persona picker.
